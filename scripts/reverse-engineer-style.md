# Reverse Engineered Writing Style Analysis

## Style Characteristics from Example

### Opening Structure
- Starts with a framing question or observation
- Sets context: "If you own NVIDIA, this past week quietly answered a question..."
- Uses conversational, direct address to the reader
- Establishes the "bigger story" theme upfront

### Headline Format
- Uses emoji + descriptive title: "🟢 NVIDIA This Week: Power, Permission, and a Bottleneck"
- Emoji indicates category/tone (🟢 = positive/growth)
- Title captures the essence in 3-5 words

### Narrative Flow
1. **Opening Hook**: Question or observation that frames the week
2. **Three Key Events**: Explained sequentially, each building on the last
3. **The Connection**: Shows how events relate to each other ("together they tell a much bigger story")
4. **What Didn't Change**: Explicitly addresses stability/continuity
5. **Investor Implication**: What it means for holders
6. **Closing Reflection**: Philosophical/forward-looking statement

### Writing Techniques
- **Connecting the dots**: "Then, almost immediately after..." / "And then the third piece dropped"
- **Contrasts**: "This isn't about X, it's about Y"
- **Significance markers**: "That alone already pushes..." / "This matters because..."
- **Plain language explanations**: "In plain terms, demand is running far ahead of supply"
- **What didn't change**: Explicit section on continuity
- **Investor framing**: "So where does that leave you as an investor?"

### Tone
- Conversational but insightful
- Not hype-driven ("No rush. No panic.")
- Acknowledges complexity ("That's where the tension sits")
- Forward-looking but grounded ("Historically, moments like this...")
- Quiet confidence ("NVIDIA isn't trying to prove itself anymore")

### Key Phrases
- "quietly answered a question"
- "together they tell a much bigger story"
- "That alone already pushes..."
- "This matters because it signals..."
- "In plain terms..."
- "That's where the tension sits"
- "What didn't change is just as important"
- "So where does that leave you as an investor?"
- "No rush. No panic. Just a quiet acknowledgment"

## Prompt Template

```
Write a report about [TOPIC] for the past 7 days using this exact style:

STRUCTURE:
1. Opening Hook: Start with a question or observation that frames the week for someone who owns/holds this asset. Use direct address: "If you own [ASSET], this past week quietly answered a question..."

2. Headline: Use format: "[EMOJI] [ASSET] This Week: [3-5 word essence]"
   - Choose emoji that matches tone (🟢=positive, 🟡=neutral/mixed, 🔴=concerns, 💼=business, 🤖=tech, etc.)

3. Three Key Events: Present 3 main developments sequentially:
   - Use transitions: "First..." / "Then, almost immediately after..." / "And then the third piece dropped"
   - For each event, explain:
     * What happened (factual)
     * Why it matters ("This matters because..." / "That alone already pushes...")
     * What it signals ("This isn't about X, it's about Y")
   - Show how events connect: "together they tell a much bigger story than any one headline"

4. The Connection: Explain how the events relate:
   - "That's where the tension sits"
   - Show the bigger picture they reveal together
   - Use "In plain terms..." for clarity

5. What Didn't Change: Explicit section:
   - "What didn't change is just as important"
   - Address what remained stable
   - Acknowledge ongoing constraints/challenges

6. Investor Implication:
   - "So where does that leave you as an investor?"
   - What it means for holders
   - What to watch going forward

7. Closing Reflection:
   - Historical context: "Historically, moments like this..."
   - Forward-looking but grounded
   - Quiet confidence: "No rush. No panic. Just a quiet acknowledgment..."

TONE REQUIREMENTS:
- Conversational but insightful (like explaining to a smart friend)
- Not hype-driven - avoid "surge", "plunge", "moon" language
- Acknowledge complexity and tension
- Use plain language for clarity: "In plain terms..."
- Show connections, don't just list facts
- Write as if NVIDIA/company "isn't trying to prove itself anymore"

WRITING TECHNIQUES:
- Use transitions to connect events: "Then, almost immediately after..."
- Contrast what something IS vs ISN'T: "This isn't about X, it's about Y"
- Signal significance: "That alone already pushes..." / "This matters because..."
- Explain implications: "The fact that [X] tells you [Y]"
- Use framing: "Nothing about [X] broke this week. Nothing slowed down."
- Close with reflection: "NVIDIA isn't trying to prove itself anymore. It's trying to keep up with the world knocking on its door."

CRITICAL: Write as a flowing narrative that connects events into a bigger story. Don't use formulaic sections or bullet points. Each paragraph should flow naturally into the next, building the story.
